# FacialExpressionRecognizer
Android application which allows the recognition of facial expressions

The idea is to have fun discovering the hidden emotion behind the selfie that are now part of everyday life. Use photos from your gallery or take one instantly and discover your expressions and those of your friends.

For the detected faces will be displayed 7 facial expressions (given in percentage): neutral, happy, surprise, anger, fear, sad and disgust.

This app is intended for recreational purposes only.
Have fun.
